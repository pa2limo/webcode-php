Webstt_PHP-MVC
==============

Inspiring by Panique, http://www.dev-metal.com

An extremely simple and easy to understand MVC skeleton application, reduced to the max. Everything is as simple as possible, as manually as possible and as readable as possible. This project is - by intention - NOT a full framework, it's a bare-bone structure, written in purely native PHP ! The php-mvc skeleton tries to be the extremely slimmed down opposite of big frameworks like Zend2, Symfony or Laravel.

Why does this project exist ?
=============================

One of the biggest question in the PHP world is "How do I build an application ?". It's hard to find a good base, a good file structure and useful information on that, but at the same time there are masses of frameworks that might be really good, but really hard to understand, hard to use and extremely complex. This project tries to be some kind of naked skeleton bare-bone for quick application building, especially for the not-so-advanced coder.

Goals of this project:
======================
give people a clean base MVC structure to build a modern PHP application with
teach people the basics of the Model-View-Controller architecture
encourage people to code according to PSR 1/2 coding guidelines.
promote the usage of PDO.
promote the usage of external libraries via Composer.
promote development with max. error reporting.
promote to comment code.
promote the usage of OOP code.
using only native PHP code.

SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO LEARN A FRAMEWORK
